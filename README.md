Analyzing Century-Long Trends in US Per Capita Kilocalorie Consumption
This repository contains the final report for my university project:
“Analyzing Century-Long Trends in US Per Capita Kilocalorie Consumption: A Multimodal Approach Using Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Principal Component Analysis”

Project Summary
This project analyzes over 100 years of per capita kilocalorie consumption trends in the United States using data collected by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) from 1909 to 2010.
The study applies a multimodal approach:
- Supervised learning models: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression
- Unsupervised learning model: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The dataset includes average consumption of kilocalories and macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, fiber).
The supervised models aim to predict kilocalorie intake based on other nutrient variables, while PCA explores relationships and hidden structures within the data.
